- **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector and keyword search for better results
- **Collection Management**: Create, organize, and manage knowledge collections

### Supported File Types
- **JSON**: Structured data with metadata
- **CSV**: Tabular data with headers
- **Markdown**: Text documents with sections
- **Plain Text**: General text files
- **HTML**: Web content (basic parsing)

## üõ† Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Weaviate Cloud account
2. Valid Weaviate credentials in `.env` file

### Environment Variables
Add these to your `.env` file:
```bash
WEAVIATE_URL=https://your-cluster-url.weaviate.network
WEAVIATE_API_KEY=your-weaviate-api-key
```

### Installation
The Weaviate agent is automatically included when you install the Deep Agents package. Make sure you have the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install weaviate-client>=4.9.5
```

## üìñ Usage

### 1. Web Research & Knowledge Base Creation

**Research a topic and create a collection:**
```
Research "artificial intelligence trends 2024" and create a knowledge base collection
```

**Research multiple topics:**
```
Research renewable energy solutions and create a collection called "ClimateSolutions"
```

### 2. File Upload & Processing

**Upload JSON data:**
```
I've uploaded a JSON file called "data.json" with machine learning information. 
Please process it and add it to a collection called "MLKnowledge"
```

**Upload CSV data:**
```
Process this CSV data and add it to a collection:
title,content,topic,difficulty
Python Basics,Introduction to Python,Programming,Beginner
```

**Upload Markdown:**
```
Process this Markdown document and add it to a collection:
# Introduction to AI
This is a comprehensive guide...
```

### 3. Semantic Search

**Search across all collections:**
```
Search for information about "machine learning algorithms"
```

**Search in specific collection:**
```
Search for "blockchain technology" in the BlockchainKnowledge collection
```

**Hybrid search:**
```
Perform a hybrid search for "artificial intelligence" to find both exact matches and similar concepts
```

### 4. Collection Management

**List all collections:**
```
Show me all available collections and their basic information
```

**Get collection details:**
```
Show me detailed information about the TechTopics collection
```

  "difficulty": "Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
}
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Research Assistant
- Research topics and build comprehensive knowledge bases
- Organize information by categories and difficulty levels
- Search for specific information across all research

### 2. Document Management
- Upload and process various file types
- Create searchable knowledge bases from documents
- Organize documents by topics and tags

### 3. Knowledge Discovery
