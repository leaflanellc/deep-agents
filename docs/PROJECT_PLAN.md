# Deep Agents Setup Project Plan

## Overview
Setting up the Deep Agents project from LangChain AI to create a general-purpose deep agent with sub-agent spawning, todo list capabilities, and mock file system capabilities.

## Project Status
- [x] Clone repository from GitHub
- [x] Set up Python environment and install dependencies
- [x] Test basic functionality
- [x] Answer LangGraph server requirements question

## Key Components
1. **Core Dependencies**: LangGraph, LangChain, Anthropic Claude
2. **Built-in Features**: Planning tool, sub-agents, virtual file system, detailed prompts
3. **Example**: Research agent with internet search capabilities

## Dependencies Analysis
- **Python**: >=3.11,<4.0
- **Core**: langgraph>=1.0.0a3, langchain-anthropic>=0.1.23, langchain>=1.0.0a10
- **Optional**: tavily-python (for research example)

## LangGraph Server Requirements
**Answer**: No, you do NOT need a local LangGraph server to run this. The deepagents library runs as a standalone Python package that uses LangGraph as a dependency, not as a separate server. You can run it directly in your Python environment.

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies
2. Test basic setup
3. Run example research agent
4. Document findings

## Environment Setup
- Created `.env` file for API key management
- Installed `python-dotenv` for loading environment variables
- Updated examples to use `.env` file configuration
- Created `env_example.py` to demonstrate proper setup

## Usage with .env File
1. Update `.env` file with your actual API keys
2. Run examples: `python env_example.py` or `python server/simple_agent_server.py`
3. Research agent: `python -c "from deepagents import research_agent; print('Research agent loaded')"`
